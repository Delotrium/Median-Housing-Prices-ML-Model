# Median-Housing-Prices-ML-Model
Using Machine learning to find median house price from other attributes.

Using data from the 1990 census to plot and predict the median house value given some attributes (eg. median income, total rooms,housing median age). Data can be found in a CSV file which is downloaded from the "dataset.py" file. This is a work in progress and just a small and fun project.
